# honeybee modules for grasshopper
This folder includes the honeybee modules only for Grasshopper. In order to create the full library for Grasshopper you need to add these files to the [core honeybee library](http://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee/tree/master/honeybee):

1. Install honeybee library from [honeybee repository](http://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee).
2. Copy the files from this folder next to the files in honeybee.

You can use this library inside Grasshopper. If you want to avoid steps 1 and 2 you can also get the latest stable released library from [here]().
